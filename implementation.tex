	The project is divided into four parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[hardware] For the hardware part of the project, we use Robosapien Interactive Robot, a prototype of a real humanoid made by NASA, to which we included a variety of sensors that are either attached to a robot or on an additional device, some of them are a Object Recognition which is connected to Computer Vision, Object Capture sensor and microphone for Voice Recognition. Also, an Oculus VR set is used for robot control. \\
		\item[software] The software part consists of Computer Vision, Voice Recognition, which is used for robot control. Moreover using QR code Recognition, serving the robot management.
		\item[algorithms] To communicate with the robot adequately use a time-tested method, namely infrared control. For feedback (robot - human), we measure the vital metrics of the user using the entire Set.
		\item[communication] The algorithms that we have implemented are for Computer Vision, which aims to plan the robot's path and QR recognition, which allows the robot to find a solution when find an obstacle.
