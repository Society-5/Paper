	\textit{"Towards Future Society 5.0: Modeling, Exploration \& Understanding"} is a big project which aims to represent the future technologies at the current moment. Some of these technologies which will build up \textit{Society 5.0} are artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the humanoids/robots. \\ \\
	Artificial intelligence is one of the most popular techniques at the moment because of its efficiency for non-optimization problems. \\ \\
	On the other side we have virtual reality which allows us to create unreal environment. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical, creating an experience that is not possible in ordinary physical reality. \\ \\
