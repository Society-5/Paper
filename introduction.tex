	\textit{"Towards Future Society 5.0: Modeling, Exploration \& Understanding"} is a big project which aims to represent the future technologies at the current moment. Some of these technologies which will build up \textit{Society 5.0} are artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the humanoids/robots. \\ \\
	Artificial intelligence is one of the most popular techniques at the moment because of its efficiency for non-optimization problems. \\ \\
	On the other side we have virtual reality which allows us to create unreal environment. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical, creating an experience that is not possible in ordinary physical reality. \\ \\
	But humanoids is not just sci-fi. There are some big companies which are developing lots of prototypes of this kind of robots for domestic tasks and to help to people in their daily life. \\ \\ 
	So because of all of this we started working on this project and we developed a prototype of future mission to Mars by using NASA's prototype robot - Robosapien. \\ \\
	Our project can help in simulating the mission on Earth and make easier debugging the software of the future investigators.
